Description:  The package implements a scalable and tuning parameter-free FDR control procedure for large-scale multiple testing exploiting the auxiliary information that reflects the order of the prior null probability. Both the prior null probabilities and the alternative p-value distribution are estimated using isotonic regression (pool-adjacent-violators algorithm).
